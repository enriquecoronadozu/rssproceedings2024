<b>Abstract:</b>  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">  
Language provides a way to break down complex concepts into digestible pieces. Recent works in robot imitation learning have proposed learning language-conditioned policies that predict actions given visual observations and the high-level task specified in language. These methods leverage the structure of natural language to share data between semantically similar tasks (e.g., "pick coke can" and "pick an apple") in multi-task datasets. However, as tasks become more semantically diverse (e.g., "pick coke can" and "pour cup"), sharing data between tasks becomes harder and thus learning to map high-level tasks to actions requires substantially more demonstration data. To bridge this divide between tasks and actions, our insight is to teach the robot the language of actions, describing low-level motions with more fine-grained phrases like "move arm forward" or "close gripper". Predicting these *language motions* as an intermediate step between high-level tasks and actions forces the policy to learn the shared structure of low-level motions across seemingly disparate tasks. Furthermore, a policy that is conditioned on language motions can easily be *corrected* during execution through human-specified language motions. This enables a new paradigm for flexible policies that can learn from human intervention in language. Our method RT-H builds an *action hierarchy* using language motions: it first learns to predict language motions, and conditioned on this along with the high-level task, it then predicts actions, using visual context at all stages. Experimentally we show that RT-H leverages this language-action hierarchy to learn policies that are more robust and flexible by effectively tapping into multi-task datasets. We show that these policies not only allow for responding to language interventions, but can also learn from such interventions and outperform methods that learn from teleoperated interventions.
