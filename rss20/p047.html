<b>Abstract:</b>  
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">  
Although autonomous robots have great potential to
 boost efficiency and throughput across the whole retail chain, they
 are mostly being deployed in large warehouses and distribution
 centers. Deploying robots in stores with customers, such as supermarkets, requires substantially more development efforts since
 they need to safely operate around customers and reliably cope
 with various uncertainties and disturbances, such as misplaced
 products. We present our recent efforts in developing a mobile
 manipulator platform for order picking in realistic supermarket
 settings. Our robot platform uses state-of-the-art perception and
 planning algorithms to robustly pick items in the presence of
 disturbances. In particular, it successfully demonstrates adaptive
 decision making and rapid replanning. Our robot allows adding
 new products and teaching new picking maneuvers from demonstrations. We validated our robot in a recreated supermarket in
 our lab and in a test supermarket of a large Dutch retailer. Our
 results show how our robot successfully recovers from various
 disturbances, including misplaced products, errors in picking,
 and from human interaction. We summarize our lessons learned
 to bring autonomous robots into real retail environments with
 customers.
